# Puzzle Detector Pro

An advanced web-based application that uses computer vision to help find where puzzle pieces fit in complex puzzles with 500+ pieces.

## üß© Overview

Puzzle Detector Pro is a sophisticated puzzle-solving assistant that uses your device's camera to detect where individual puzzle pieces belong in a completed puzzle. Using advanced computer vision algorithms through OpenCV.js, it features high-resolution image capture with optimized detection for both simple and complex puzzles.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Features
- **High-Resolution Photo Capture**: Takes full-resolution photos instead of video frames for reference images
- **Multi-Scale Detection**: Works with puzzles of various sizes, from simple to 500+ pieces
- **Dual Camera View**: Capture the reference puzzle image in the upper view and detect individual pieces in the lower view
- **Portrait Mode Enforcement**: Automatically detects device orientation and prompts for portrait mode
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for use on smartphones and tablets
- **No Server Required**: Runs entirely in the browser with no data sent to any server

### Advanced Detection Technology
- **Multi-Resolution Image Pyramid**: Uses 4 levels of resolution for efficient detection
- **Two-Stage Detection Process**: Quick coarse matching followed by precise refinement
- **Adaptive Scale Increments**: Uses finer increments (0.05) for small pieces in 500+ piece puzzles
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Optimization**: Focuses detailed detection in promising areas only
- **Multiple Matching Algorithms**: Combines different OpenCV matching methods for better results
- **Histogram Equalization**: Improves detection under varying lighting conditions
- **Smart Resource Management**: Caches processed images for better performance

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Camera access on your device
- For best results, use good lighting conditions

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/puzzle-detector-pro.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd puzzle-detector-pro
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a web server. 
   - For local development, you can use:
     ```
     npx http-server .
     ```
   - Or with Python:
     ```
     python -m http.server
     ```

4. Access through your browser (usually at http://localhost:8080)

## üì± How to Use

1. **Capture High-Resolution Reference Image**:
   - Place your completed puzzle in view of the camera
   - Tap the upper section to capture a high-resolution photo
   - The app will automatically process the image for optimal detection

2. **Detect Puzzle Pieces**:
   - Once the reference is captured, the lower section activates
   - Position individual puzzle pieces within the green outline
   - The app will show where in the reference image your piece belongs
   - Confidence percentage indicates how certain the match is

3. **Reset**:
   - Double-tap the lower section or tap the upper section to reset and recapture the reference

## üîß Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations

- **Multi-Resolution Approach**:
  - Uses an image pyramid with 4 resolution levels
  - Initial matching at lowest resolution for maximum speed
  - Refines matches at higher resolutions for accuracy

- **Adaptive Scale Detection**:
  - Uses coarse scale increments for initial matching [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]
  - Automatically switches to finer increments (0.05) for small pieces
  - Full scale range from 0.25 to 1.75 to detect pieces of all sizes

- **Reference Image Caching**:
  - Pre-processes and caches grayscale, blurred, and equalized versions of the reference image
  - Creates and stores an image pyramid to avoid repeated downsampling
  - Properly manages OpenCV resources to prevent memory leaks

- **Region of Interest (ROI) Optimization**:
  - After finding a coarse match, only searches within a region around it
  - Dramatically reduces the search area for refined matching

### Computer Vision Techniques

- **Multiple Template Matching Methods**:
  - Uses both `cv.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED` and `cv.TM_CCORR_NORMED` matching methods
  - Each method excels at detecting different types of puzzle pieces
  - Dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds based on the method used

- **Image Enhancement**:
  - Applies histogram equalization to both reference and template images
  - Helps with varying lighting conditions and improves matching quality
  - Gaussian blur reduces noise for more reliable matching

- **Efficient Processing**:
  - Uses `cv.INTER_NEAREST` for faster initial resizing
  - Intelligent memory management for better performance
